# Burger App

The primary focus of this project was to follow the Model-View-Controller paradigm. As such, the application itself is simple and the UI is relatively bare bones. This project also made use of made use of JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, and MySql. The application allows for the ability to add burgers to a database, which then can be eaten with a click of a button. The burgers are then moved on the page and updated in the database. 

## Installation

To run and develop the code for yourself, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

In order to use this application as intended, you must have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Step-by-step installation instructions can be found [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows). 

You must also install mysql (for database interaction), express-handlebars (for the HTML views), and Express (for running a server on your machine), which you can install by calling `npm init` and `npm install` from the command line. For more detailed information, check out the documentation for [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql), [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars), and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). 

To get the database up and running, you can use the schema and the seeds provided. I used [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) with [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) as an editor.
